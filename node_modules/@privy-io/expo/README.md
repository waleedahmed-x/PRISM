# @privy-io/expo

The Privy Expo SDK allows you to integrate Privy into a bare React Native or Expo app. With Privy, your app can authenticate your users across email, phone, social, and wallet login methods and securely create embedded wallets for them to take onchain actions.

## Installation

Install along with [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies) using `npm`:

```sh
npx expo install expo-application expo-constants expo-linking expo-web-browser expo-secure-store react-native-webview @privy-io/expo
```

Install [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill), these should be imported as early as possible in your application.

```sh
npm i react-native-get-random-values @ethersproject/shims
```
